# twitterbot
This is JavaScript code that connects to the Twitter API to automatically generate tweets, once per hour. This particular Twitter bot creates tweets that reflect the caricature of modern millennial humor. 
The terminal must be running the program real-time in order for the Twitter bot itself to generate tweets.
Install this Twitter bot by downloading the TwitterBot.js file. Have appropriate Twitter API information loaded in the directory. Go into the directory of the file in terminal and compile.
